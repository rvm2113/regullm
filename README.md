Problem Statement

Organizations in finance, healthcare, and manufacturing face constant changes in regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, OSHA). Compliance teams must sift through hundreds of pages of dense legal text to extract actionable rules, check for violations, and update internal policies.
Traditional keyword search misses context, and human review is slow, costly, and prone to oversight.
Objective

Build an AI-powered compliance document analysis system that:

    Ingests and organizes regulatory/legal documents.

    Embeds content for semantic search and similarity checks.

    Uses fine-tuned LLM models to extract, summarize, and verify compliance clauses.

    Allows natural language querying for compliance rules.

    Supports policy-vs-regulation gap analysis for audits.

System Overview

Pipeline Steps:

    Data Ingestion

        Source compliance docs (e.g., GDPR text, HIPAA regulations, ISO standards).

        Use OCR + PDF parsers for scanned docs.

        Store structured content in a document store (e.g., PostgreSQL + pgvector, or Pinecone).

    Preprocessing

        Split docs into chunks (semantic sections) with metadata: regulation name, section number, topic.

        Remove boilerplate headers/footers.

        Normalize citations and references.

    Embedding Generation

        Use domain-tuned embeddings (e.g., text-embedding-3-large or fine-tuned MiniLM) to create vector representations of chunks.

        Store embeddings in a vector DB for semantic search.

    Fine-Tuning LLM

        Train a domain-specific LLM variant on compliance Q&A pairs.

        Focus on:

            Clause summarization.

            Policy gap analysis.

            “Is this scenario compliant?” reasoning.

        Option: Fine-tune on instructions from compliance professionals.

    Natural Language Interface

        Accept user queries: “What are HIPAA encryption requirements?” or “Does our policy violate Section 5.1 of GDPR?”

        Retrieve relevant clauses via embedding search → feed into fine-tuned LLM for final answer.

        Include citations to original clauses for audit traceability.

    Compliance Gap Checker

        Compare internal policy docs (input by user) against regulatory embeddings.

        Highlight missing or conflicting clauses.
Key ML Components
Component	ML Technique	Purpose
Text Parsing & Chunking	Rule-based NLP + transformers	Prepare documents for semantic search
Embeddings	Sentence Transformers / OpenAI embeddings	Context-aware retrieval
LLM Fine-tuning	Instruction tuning / LoRA	Domain specialization for compliance reasoning
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)	Hybrid search + LLM	Cite exact clauses in answers
Clause Classification	Zero-shot or fine-tuned classifier	Label clauses by compliance category
Evaluation Metrics

    Retrieval Quality: Recall@k, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) for embedding search.

    Summarization Quality: ROUGE, BERTScore, plus human review from compliance SMEs.

    Gap Detection Accuracy: % of missing clauses correctly flagged.

    LLM Response Accuracy: Human evaluation for correctness + explainability.

Tech Stack

    Data: Public compliance/legal datasets (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO standards, US CFR)

    LLM: LLaMA-3, Mistral, or GPT fine-tuned via LoRA / PEFT

    Embeddings: text-embedding-3-large, Instructor-XL, or all-MiniLM-L6-v2

    Vector DB: pgvector, Weaviate, or Pinecone

    Backend: FastAPI + LangChain for orchestration

    Frontend: Streamlit / React dashboard for query & results visualization

    Deployment: Docker + cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)

Why This is Capstone-Worthy

    Combines document ingestion, embeddings, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented LLM reasoning.

    Solves a real-world, high-value business problem in compliance/legal tech.

    Involves measurable outcomes for both IR (Information Retrieval) and NLP reasoning tasks.

    Bridges research concepts (LoRA fine-tuning, RAG) and production engineering (vector DB, API, dashboard).
