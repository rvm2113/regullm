Problem Statement

Organizations in finance, healthcare, and manufacturing face constant changes in regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, OSHA). Compliance teams must sift through hundreds of pages of dense legal text to extract actionable rules, check for violations, and update internal policies.
Traditional keyword search misses context, and human review is slow, costly, and prone to oversight.
Objective

Build an AI-powered compliance document analysis system that:

    Ingests and organizes regulatory/legal documents.

    Embeds content for semantic search and similarity checks.

    Uses fine-tuned LLM models to extract, summarize, and verify compliance clauses.

    Allows natural language querying for compliance rules.

    Supports policy-vs-regulation gap analysis for audits.

System Overview

Pipeline Steps:

    Data Ingestion

        Source compliance docs (e.g., GDPR text, HIPAA regulations, ISO standards).

        Use OCR + PDF parsers for scanned docs.

        Store structured content in a document store (e.g., PostgreSQL + pgvector, or Pinecone).

    Preprocessing

        Split docs into chunks (semantic sections) with metadata: regulation name, section number, topic.

        Remove boilerplate headers/footers.

        Normalize citations and references.

    Embedding Generation

        Use domain-tuned embeddings (e.g., text-embedding-3-large or fine-tuned MiniLM) to create vector representations of chunks.

        Store embeddings in a vector DB for semantic search.

    Fine-Tuning LLM

        Train a domain-specific LLM variant on compliance Q&A pairs.

        Focus on:

            Clause summarization.

            Policy gap analysis.

            “Is this scenario compliant?” reasoning.

        Option: Fine-tune on instructions from compliance professionals.

    Natural Language Interface

        Accept user queries: “What are HIPAA encryption requirements?” or “Does our policy violate Section 5.1 of GDPR?”

        Retrieve relevant clauses via embedding search → feed into fine-tuned LLM for final answer.

        Include citations to original clauses for audit traceability.

    Compliance Gap Checker

        Compare internal policy docs (input by user) against regulatory embeddings.

        Highlight missing or conflicting clauses.

Why This is Capstone-Worthy

    Combines document ingestion, embeddings, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented LLM reasoning.

    Solves a real-world, high-value business problem in compliance/legal tech.

    Involves measurable outcomes for both IR (Information Retrieval) and NLP reasoning tasks.

    Bridges research concepts (LoRA fine-tuning, RAG) and production engineering (vector DB, API, dashboard).
